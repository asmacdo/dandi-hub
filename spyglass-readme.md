## Setup

cd docker
./hostsetup.sh

In dandihub terminal 1
cd dshare
./deploy-mysql.sh


In dandihub terminal 2
cd dshare
./spy-d.sh

## Notes

clean.sh should cleanup the dshare dir

datajoint/mysql
- Running mysql works just fine on my local machine.
- datajoint/mysql works sometimes inside of dandihub (locally)
